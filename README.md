# Product Sale Research
## Sale Predictions on Products within Supermarkets and Grocery Stores

**Authored by:** Eric N. Valdez

### Business problem:

Discovering the the best out come of Product Sales through different stores. 


### Data:
Through several weeks this project will look at many different ways to see the data, to solve problems on sale products for diffferent 
store locations, it will help you see where improvemnets can be made for opportunities. You will be able to see insights from the beginning.


## Methods
- From the beginning we've been able to chart different graphs to help see where the sale issues are
- We've been able to take it further with Machine learning to see different ways are target is affected 
- 

## Results

#### Heat Map of Prediction of Product Sales

> Our heat map allows us to look at how we see our Item Oulet Sales correlates between other features that can affect our problem 

#### Random Forest Regressor Pipeline

## Model

Random Forest Model allows us to classify and look at ther regression, it can be less sensitive to noise and outliers in the data

### Regression Metrics: Training Data 

- MAE = 296.836
- MSE = 182, 909.354
- RMSE = 427.679
- $R^2$ = 0.938
  
### Regression Metrics: Test Data

- MAE = 776.805
- MSE = 1,245,831.112
- RMSE = 1,116.168
- $R^2$ = 0.555

This type of modeling creates a set of decission trees and combines them to make more accurate and stable predictions, 
and helps in Sales forecasting

## Recommendations:

Overall my Random Forest Model came high in $R^2$ after it was tuned allowing us to see what could be forecasted, however .5 is still low, 
and getting it to close to the 100% mark is going to take some more tuning to see what method can overall work for the company.


## Limitations & Next Steps

Next step is to see how other models will do with information and take the project to better routes.
